This analysis is part of the [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) guided project I worked on while learning algorithm complexity.

**Suggested Extended Analysis**

1. Imagine that we extend our budget query to take as input a range of prices, min_price and max_price, rather than a single price. Write a query that finds all laptops whose price is in the given range.

2. Sometimes, a customer wants a laptop with some characteristics such as, for instance, 8GB or RAM and a 256GB hard drive. It would be interesting for those customers to provide a way to find the cheapest laptop that matches the desired characteristics. For simplicity, focus only on the amount of RAM and hard drive capacity. You might need to convert those values to integers rather than using strings.
